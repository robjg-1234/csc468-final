# csc468-final
 AI Search Analysis
[Prototype](https://robjg-1234.github.io/csc468-final/aibuild/)

The application itself allows you to modify the size of the grid from 2x2 to 20x20. To start the simulation, you need to press the spacebar, and you can toggle the summary screen with the Tab key. Furthermore, to end the preview, you can press the spacebar only after all the simulations are completed.

Furthermore, the code for how the pathfinding is done is saved inside the [AISearch script](https://github.com/robjg-1234/csc468-final/blob/main/aisearch/Assets/Scripts/AISearch.cs). The other codes found in the folder handle the presentation of the pathfinding.
